# Snyk is recruiting!

We are an early stage startup on a mission to secure the way we build and consume open source software. We have top tier advisors and investors, including the founders of GitHub, Parse, Wix, PubNub and more.

Our users are developers just like us, and we value products that look as good on the inside as they do on the outside. Matching the expectations of other developers and solving problems they face sets a high bar for us to continuously strive towards.

We are building a remote-first company culture, focusing on engineering practices that fit the open source world. We believe in openness as the best attitude, and follow it in how we act as a team and how we build our products.

We have offices in Tel Aviv and in London, bringing in talent where we find a match :)
