## About [Snyk](https://snyk.io)

Snyk is on a mission to secure the way we create and consume open source. We analyse and protect your projects, eliminating known vulnerabilities and securing applications in runtime.

Developers care a lot about security, but have too few options to actually do something about it. We make security an aspect of quality, built into the software from the start.

We are focusing on npm and the NodeJS ecosystem. Our tech stack starts with JavaScript and NodeJS. Redis, Postgres and Titan graph DB play their roles in our back-end architecture.

Our DevOps stack includes AWS, CI/CD with github + travis + docker and blue/green deployments.

We run a distributed team between our London and Tel Aviv offices. We communicate over Slack and zoom.us more than we rely on email. Any process we want to adopt manifests in a slack integration keeping everyone informed. Jira helps us manage our two-week sprints, and helps us run our daily standup meetings. Analytics with keen.io and mixpanel show us how we are doing with our users. Intercom.io keeps us in touch.

We are still hiring for our single-digit person team. Cultural fit is as important as tech savvyness, if not more!

When asked about dog-friendliness in our offices, we point to our dog logo to answer. Feline friends are welcome as well :)
