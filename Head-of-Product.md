## About [Snyk](https://snyk.io)

Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. 
Open Source code, pulled from npm, Maven, RubyGems and others, is often the majority of code in an application, and yet it receives no security attention. 
Most developers do nothing to track known vulnerabilities in the packages they use, and trust this code as though its their own. 
This risk is massive today, and is only made worse by growing use of packages and trends such as Serverless and PaaS, who secure the server's dependencies but leave the app to fend with its dependencies security alone.

At Snyk we believe this problem can only be fixed by developers and DevOps teams, and built into the way we create software. 
We build a SaaS CI/CD and runtime monitoring product that helps organisations continuosly find and fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down.

It's important to understand Snyk is a dev tooling company at heart. 
We care about securing the open source world itself as much as as we care about our enterprise grade solution that let large companies consume open source code while controlling risk. 
We receive regular community contributions (and love!), have more than 600 badges in GitHub championing us, and continuously protect over 10,000 open source repositories. 

Lastly, Snyk is a growth oriented venture backed company. We raised a $3M seed round from US investors in October '15, and received another large infusion from our investors recently, demonstrating their excitement about our progress and potential. 
Our team numbers 17 amazing people in two large offices in Tel Aviv & London, and a smaller presence in the US. We take a lot of care to keep a warm and inclusive environment, and make sure our distributed team gets plenty of face time over video and in trips.
